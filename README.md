# Random Password Generator 

## Description

The aim of this project was to modify starter code to create an application that generates a random password based on criteria selected by the user. 

## Usage

When the 'Generate Password' button is clicked, the user is asked to select criteria (including: password length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters) through a series of window prompts and window confirms. 
The user input is then used to generate a random password which is then written to the page. 
The password length must be between 8 - 128 characters; if the user enters a length outside of these parameters, they are asked to try again and will have to click the 'generate password' button again. The user will also be asked to try again if they do not select at least one criteria.
